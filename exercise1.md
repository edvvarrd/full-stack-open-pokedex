Assuming that the application is coded in Python and is worked on by 6 people I would set up a CI pipeline that firstly uses Ruff, which is a very fast Linter with many built-in rules - that would assure me that the whole code is clean and easily maintainable.
Since the application is written in Python, a building step is not mandatory, unless an implementation of some dependencies is required, so the next step would be testing - which I would use PyTest for - making writing of the tests and handling potential failures easier.
After that, if everything goes green, it's time to merge the main branch and push tested code to production.
To set up a whole process, instead of Jenkins and GitHub Actions, a popular alternatives to use are GitLab, TeamCity and Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. The choice would probably depend on the detailed specification of the app and preferences of other developers.
Therefore, when it comes to picking between self-hosted and cloud-based solution, assuming that the app is fairly small or medium-sized (as there are only 6 people working on it), the cloud-based environment like GitHub Actions or GitLab would be my pick.
Surely, all the choices I described above could vary depending on a more detailed plan of the development, but I think these solutions would be pretty flexible and robust considering the given circumstances.
